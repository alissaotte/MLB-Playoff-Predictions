# MLB-Playoff-Predictions

This project was a collaborative effort with my team for my Data Mining class. We were to find/create a dataset in which we could use to showcase methods we learned for prediction and classification using R in R Studio. We decided to focus on using classification to predict whether an MLB team would make it to the playoffs or not using statistics from all MLB teams from the past 5 years, excluding 2020 due to a shortened season and different rules to adjust for the COVID-19 pandemic. In this script, we showcase our use of EDA by creating various plots and a correlation matrix, a full logistic regression model, random forest for classification, and determining the best k-NN for classification.

As for my individual contribution, I wrote the code for creating dummy variables, partitioning the data, random forest for classification, and determining best k for classification.
